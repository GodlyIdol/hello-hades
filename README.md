# hello-hades
I didn't feel inclined to say Hello to the world per se; though Satan's cool in my book. Therefore, Hello Hades and Hello Github!

hmmm I wont devulge my name here for obvious reasons. Im sure most can figure that out if they wanted. I am new to the community and I have much to learn. Eager and hungry. please dont take my Repo title as negative. Im just a cynical pisces moon and I like the dark occultish themes hehe. any and all help for a noob is more than welcomed. Im a nice guy really. also excuse my grammer. im just a math geek not an english major aka im lazy...
